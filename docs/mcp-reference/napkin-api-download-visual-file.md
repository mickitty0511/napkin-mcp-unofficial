# Download generated file

> **Source:** https://api.napkin.ai/api/download-visual-file

Download a specific file generated by a completed visual request.

Important Notes:
- The complete download URL is provided in the `generated_files` array from the status endpoint — do not construct it manually.
- Authentication headers are required to download the file content.
- Files should be downloaded and hosted elsewhere for display — do not hotlink these URLs in your app.
- Both status and file URLs expire ~30 minutes after generation.

## Endpoint

```
GET /v1/visual/{request-id}/file/{file-id}
```

## Authentication

Include your Napkin API token in the `Authorization` header for every download request.

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE
```

## Parameters (YAML)

```yaml
parameters:
  path:
    request-id:
      type: string
      format: uuid
      required: true
      behavior: Unique identifier of the visual request.
    file-id:
      type: string
      required: true
      behavior: Unique identifier of the file to download (from generated_files in status response).
```

Files are only available for requests with status "completed". The response includes appropriate `Content-Type` and `Content-Length` headers for the file.

## Example

```bash
curl -L "https://api.napkin.ai/v1/visual/123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000/file/426614174000-wdjvjhwv8" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE" \
  -o visual.svg
```

## 200 OK — Response headers

- Content-Type: MIME type of the file (e.g., `image/svg+xml`, `image/png`)
- Content-Length: Size of the file in bytes

## Errors

- 400 Invalid request ID or file ID format
