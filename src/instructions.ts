const INSTRUCTIONS_USAGE = [
  "[Usage]",
  "1) Typical tool flow:",
  "   - Create or regenerate -> get status (poll) -> get download headers",
  "2) Method selection:",
  "   - To change structure: use napkin_create_visual_request",
  "   - To change content only: use napkin_regenerate_visual",
  "3) Capturing context:",
  "   - Gather audience, medium, platform, and constraints, then place them in the context field before calling tools.",
  "   - Request audience and use case when they are missing, then continue once you capture them.",
  "   - Keep context concise (at most two short sentences) and concrete.",
  "4) Choosing visual_query / visual_queries:",
  "   - Prefer LLM semantic inference from content + context; avoid relying solely on keyword presence.",
  "   - If user content/context already specifies a visual type, adopt it.",
  "   - Otherwise, choose clear layout types (e.g., 'timeline', 'flowchart', 'mind map', 'funnel', 'pyramid').",
  "   - ALWAYS use English query strings for visual_query and visual_queries.",
  "   - For multiple visuals, provide distinct queries equal to number_of_visuals.",
  "   - Optional hints: napkin-docs://docs/visual_variations/visual_query_keywords_by_category.md",
  "5) Choosing styles:",
  "   - Prefer English style names/keywords; if suggesting a specific style, use its English name.",
  "   - If you specify a style explicitly, map the name to style_id from the catalog doc.",
  "   - Otherwise omit style_id; the server will auto-select based on content/context.",
  "   - Catalog: napkin-docs://docs/visual_variations/style_keywords_by_category.md",
  "6) Text language on visuals (BCP 47):",
  "   - Accept 'language' as a BCP 47 string (e.g., en, en-US, ja-JP).",
  "   - Consult https://r12a.github.io/app-subtags/ when needed.",
  "   - If content/context indicates auto lookup (e.g., 'bcp47:auto' or 'language:auto'), pick an appropriate tag via the subtag lookup.",
  "   - If language is omitted or environment variable NAPKIN_DEFAULT_LANGUAGE and content/context is different, propose 2窶・ likely BCP 47 candidates from content/context and ask the user to confirm.",
].join("\n");

// Rendering / parameters behavior and caveats
const INSTRUCTIONS_RENDERING = [
  "[Rendering Options]",
  "- format:",
  "  - Accepts svg | png | ppt.",
  "  - Set width/height only when format is 'png' (MCP validation enforces this).",
  "- transparent_background:",
  "  - Default false. Primarily impacts PNG output.",
  "  - SVG/PPT may ignore this; prefer PNG when you need transparency.",
  "- inverted_color:",
  "  - Default false. Inverts colors for better contrast on dark backgrounds.",
  "  - May reduce legibility with certain styles; use only when clearly requested.",
  "- width / height (PNG only):",
  "  - Integers 100..10000; nullable.",
  "  - Provide at most one dimension; if both are provided, width takes precedence and the other is inferred upstream.",
  "  - If format != 'png' and width/height are set, request is invalid (blocked by MCP validation).",
  "- orientation:",
  "  - One of auto | horizontal | vertical | square (hint).",
  "  - May take priority over visual_query/visual_queries when layouts cannot satisfy both the query and orientation.",
